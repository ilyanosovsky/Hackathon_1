# Hackathon_1
our first Hackathon #1 Ilya and Ivan <Full_Snack_Devs/>

To Run our Games we need to Run Python file "main.py" 
You will get a menu in Terminal where you can Choose which game you want to Play : 

1. Dino - It is a 2D Running game where you jump over the cactuses ðŸŒµ 
2. Space Game - It is an analog of famous "Space Invenders" ðŸ‘¾

After you play the game you can Run "main.py" again and play as many times as you want
For "Dino" weâ€™ve decided to store our High Score on Server in DataBase
For "Space Game" we just stores our High Score in "highscore.txt"

Enjoy the Game!
